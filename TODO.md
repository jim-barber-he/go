# Things to do

* Improvements for `ssm` command:
  * Handle getting and putting tags.
  * Implement `copy` command.
* Improve / add tests for the AWS code once I work out how to mock AWS services.
* Add --version flags to everything? Since they are all in the 1 repo have it use CalVer (YYYY.0M.0D) at build time perhaps?
