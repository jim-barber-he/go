# Things to do

* Add README.md
* Make repo public.
* Add JSON output for the `get` and `list` commands for `ssm`.
* Improve tests and add tests for the AWS stuff once I work out how to mock them.
* `ssm` command to handle advanced parameters; policies; intelligent tiering.
* Implement `ssm copy` command.
* Command line completion for the --namespace option in k8s commands.
